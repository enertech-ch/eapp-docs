### Addressbooks
Conacts are organized in Address Books. User can be granted access to manage Address Books and Contacts.

#### Create
To create an Address Book, click the field {{<lga-lbl text="Start typing to add">}} in the Address Book bar on the left side and fill in the name of the Address Book. Click the button {{<lga-btn type="negative" icon="add">}} to create the Address Book.

#### Manage
Address Books can be changed by clicking the {{<lga-btn type="negative" icon="edit">}}-icon next to the name.

Switch to tab {{<lga-tab text="Users">}} to add permitted Users. Please note, that Users with the Role "Viewer" can not change the Address Book or Contacts within it.

### Contacts

#### Create
A new Conact can be created by klicking the Button {{<lga-btn type="negative" icon="add" text="Create">}}.

#### Filter
Contacts can be filtered by text, which is applied to common fields. You can filter by entering text to the {{<lga-lbl text="Search">}}-field on the top of the list.

#### Manage
Contacts can be changed by clicking on the Name.

#### Assign Users
It's possible to assign Lexgate-Users to a Contact. When assigning a User, he will be invited to Lexgate, if no Login existis.

To assign a User, switch to {{<lga-tab text="Assigned Users">}} and enter the E-Mail Address of the User.
The changes take effect immediately. You can now assign the Contact to a Group, so the User gets access to the Analysis for this Group.
